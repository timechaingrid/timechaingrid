/**
 * (site) layout — the standard document-style shell applied to every
 * regular page (`/`, `/about`, `/pricing`, `/donate`, etc.). Centers
 * content in a max-w-6xl container with the brass NavBar at top and
 * SiteFooter at the bottom.
 *
 * The kiosk routes (`/grid`) bypass this layout entirely — they're
 * outside the (site) route group and use their own full-viewport
 * layout. Route groups in Next.js App Router don't affect URLs;
 * `/about` still resolves whether the file lives at app/about/ or
 * app/(site)/about/.
